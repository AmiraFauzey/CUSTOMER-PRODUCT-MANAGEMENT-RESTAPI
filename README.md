5. **Delete a Product by ID**: Remove a product from the database using a specific ID.

**Technologies Used**
1. **Backend Framework**:Spring Boot 3.3.3
2. **Database**: MySQL
3. **Build Tool**: Maven
4. **Java Version**: Java 17
5. **API Documentation Tool**: Swagger
6. **Testing Framework**: JUnit, Mockito
7. **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA 2024

**Database Configuration**
The Spring boot application uses MySQL as its database. To configure the database, update the `application.properties` file as below:
```properties
spring.application.name=customerProductManagement
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/customer_product_management_db?allowPublicKeyRetrieval=true&useSSL=false
spring.datasource.username=username
spring.datasource.password=password

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```
